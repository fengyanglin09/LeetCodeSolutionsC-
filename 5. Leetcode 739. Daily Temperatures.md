## 739. Daily Temperatures

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

## My Solutions


### Analysis:

The question is basically asking for the next larger element for any element in an integer array.

So it is equivalent to how to store the information of the next larger element? 
To obtain such information, we will need to scan the array 

Can it be solved by scanning the array from left to right?
bc we need the next larger number, so we will need to use Method 1, brute force, which takes O(n^2)

can it be solved by scanning the array from right to left?
<pre>
Algorithm:
1. let T be the temperatures array of size n, and we will scan from T[n-1] to T[0]
2. we will also use a stack S to store temperatures scanned from right to left
3. everytime a temperature T[i] is scanned, we will compare it with S.top() 
    a. if S is empty(), then T[i] will be pushed to S, and value for T[i] will 0 as no larger temperature will be found
    b. if T[i] > S.top(), S.top() will be poped, until either T[i] < S.top() or S is empty()
            b1. if T[i] < S.top() is found, the value for T[i] can be easily calculated
            b2. if S becomes empty, then value for T[i] will be zero
4. we will also add T[i] to S

</pre>

### proof of correctness:

Question: will the above algorithm work? 

<i>A more specific question</i>: elements will be removed from stack S in step b; 
would any larger temperatures be removed for any ele that has not been scaned yet?

we will look at the following facts:
<pre>
fact 1. after an element is scanned, it will be stored in the stack S
fact 2. S.top() will be removed from S iteratively until T[i] < S.top() or S becomes empty
</pre>

From the above two facts we can see that the elements removed are smaller than the temperature T[i] currently being scanned.
After removing these smaller temperatures, T[i] will be added to S. 

Let T[j] be the largest temperature removed bc of T[i]. 

If there exist T[k] s.t. T[k] is before T[j] but after T[i] and T[k] < T[j], 
then T[k] must be removed by T[i], and its value would already be calculated by T[j] prior to scanning of T[i]

If there exist T[k] s.t. T[k] is before T[i] and T[k] < T[j],
then T[i] must be a closer larger temperature compared T[j] as T[i] > T[j] and T[i] is before T[j]
        
Therefore, the above algorithm must be correct.

```c++
//Method 2
//T(n) = O(n), bc there is only one scanning of the array
//S(n) = O(n), bc stack S all temperatures if T is sorted in ascending order
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& T) {
        stack<int> myStack;//used to store index
        int len = T.size();
        vector<int> res(len,0);
        for(int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(myStack.empty()){
                res[i] = 0;
            }else{
                while(!myStack.empty() && T[i] >= T[myStack.top()]){
                    myStack.pop();
                }
                if(myStack.empty()){
                    res[i] = 0;
                }else{
                    res[i] = myStack.top() - i;
                }
            }
            myStack.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
