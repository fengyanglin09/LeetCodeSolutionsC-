## 72. Edit Distance

<pre>

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Solutions

### Solution1

```c++
/*
Solution1 - DP 
assume s1, s2 be two strings. The objective is to edit chars in s1 to convert it to s2
only three operations allowed for editing:
a. insert;  b. delete,  c. replace

lets define dp[i][j] be the min # of ops to convert s1 ending at i th char to s2 ending at j th char,
then we have:

if s1[i] == s2[j]
dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i-1][j-1], // no operations needed if last chars of s1 and s2 ending at i and j th postion are the same
    dp[i-1][j] + 1, //one op needed to remove the last char of s1 ending at i
    dp[j][i-1] + 1 // one op needed to add the last char of s2 ending at j
)

if s1[i] != s2[j]
dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, // one operations to replace s1[i] with s2[j]
    dp[i-1][j] + 1, //one op needed to remove the last char of s1 ending at i
    dp[j][i-1] + 1 // one op needed to add the last char of s2 ending at j
)

dp[i][j] = i+1, if j<0 (if s2 is empty), then all chars in s1 will need to be deleted

dp[i][j] = j+1, if i<0 (if s1 is empty), then all chars in s2 will need to be inserted to s1

dp[i][j] = 0, if i<0 && j<0

Analysis:
T(n) = O(m*n)
S(n) = O(m*n)
