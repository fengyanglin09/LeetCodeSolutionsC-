## 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. 

You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.

Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.

Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

<pre>
Example:

Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
Note:
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

### Solution

```c++
/*
The idea is to use BSF with multiple starting point
Algorithm:
0. use BSF using buildings as starting points
1. create a 2D grid with the same dimension
2. each cell in the grid records # of visits from different starting building
3. find the minimum of all the possible paths
*/
//T(n) = O(k*(E+V)), where k is the # of buildings
