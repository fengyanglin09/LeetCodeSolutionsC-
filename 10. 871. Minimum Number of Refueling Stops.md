## 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  
Each station[i] represents a gas station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has station[i][1] liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  
If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

 
<pre>
Example 1:
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.

Example 2:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).

Example 3:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
</pre> 

Note:
<pre>
1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9
0 <= stations.length <= 500
0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < target
</pre>

## My Solutions

### Analysis
#### Naive Greedy Approach Will Not Work

For example the following greedy algorithm does not work:
<pre>
1. start from beginning
2. drive the car and to through all the stations that are reachable with the current car location and fuel amount
3. from all the reachable stations, select one that can drive farthest and respeat 2 above
4. repeat that process until the cat arrived at a position where target could be reached with the fuel amount left
5. record the # of stations need in the process
</pre>

This algorithm will not work, because we can not always greadly select the reachable station that go farthest at a time.
For example, the above algorithm will work on the following testing case:
<pre>
Target: 1000
Initial Fuel: 299
Stations: [[13,21],[26,115],[100,47],[225,99],[299,141],[444,198],[608,190],[636,157],[647,255],[841,123]]

Algorithm output: -1
expected: 4
</pre>

#### Method 2: Max Heap + Greedy
```c++
/*
Method 2: Heap + Greedy

The idea is to get all the reachable stations with the fuel and put them to a max-heap,
when the car does not have enough gas to get to the next station and has not reached the target yet, 
we go back and gas the car with the stations saved on the max-heap. Because the top station on the heap is 
alway the one with the most fuel, it will guarantee the min # of stations needed to gas the car to reach
the target, if the target is reachable.

*/

#### Method 1: BFS

```c++
/*
Method1: bfs, causing TLE, passing 124/198 cases
Analysis:
1. the problem is similar to jump through rocks from one side to the other side of a river
2. jumpping distances vary each time,
3. goal is to determine the minimum jumps required to the other side of the river
