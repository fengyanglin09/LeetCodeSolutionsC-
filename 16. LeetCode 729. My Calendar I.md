## 729. My Calendar I

Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

Your class will have the method, book(int start, int end). 
Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)

For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. 
Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)

<pre>
Example 1:

MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first event can be booked.  The second can't because time 15 is already booked by another event.
The third event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
 

Note:

The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].

#### Solution2: Binary Search
```c++

/*
Method2: Binary Search
Given a calander where events in it are sorted by the start time
To determine if a new interval A = [a,b] can be added to the calander, we want to:

1. first find (binary search) the 2 intervals in the Calendar that are closest to A
2. check to see if these two intervals overlap with A

Note: the above algorithm works because all events in A are not overlapping

there are two possible closest cases to A that may also overlap with A:
1. start time is at or after A_start and before A_end 
    A_start---------------------A_end
    1_start-------------------------------------1_end
2. start time is before A_start, but end time is after A_start
                A_start---------------------A_end
    1_start-------------------------------------1_end

        auto after = calander.lower_bound(start);
        if(after != calander.end()){

                return false;
            }
        }
        //the second closest ele should be just the ele before after, bc all intervals in Calander are no overlapping
        auto before = calander.end();
        if (after != calander.begin()){
            before = --after;
        }

#### Solution1: Brute Force
```c++
/*
Method1: Brute Force
Note: given two events A and B, there are only four cases where they overlap:
case1:
    A_start--------------------------A_end
            B_start------------------------------B_end
            
case2:
            A_start-----------------------------A_end
    B_start--------------------------B_end

case3:
            A_start-----------A_end
    B_start--------------------------------------B_end

case4:
    A_start--------------------------------------A_end
            B_start-------------------B_end

Therefore, to determine if A overlaps B, we only need to see if:

    if(max(A_start,B_start) < min(A_end,B_end))

//
T(n) = O(n^2)
S(n) = O(n)
