## 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

Example 2:
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

Note:
1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

### Solution

```c++
/*
first charactor is bit 0,
second charactor is bits 11 or 10

therefore, at any position i:
case1: if A[i] == 0, then A[i] itself must be the first charactor. Because
no mater A[i+1] ==1 or A[i+1] == 0, A[i] and A[i+1] will not be able to form second charactor.

case2: if A[i] == 1, then A[i] and A[i+1] must form the second charactor. Because
A[i] by itself in neighter first nor second charactor. And A[i+1] can be either 0 or 1 to 
make A[i] and A[i+1] form second charactor: either 11 jor 10

therefore, the question becomes to varify that we remove the last bit (which would always be zero) 
and still can determine that A contains valid charactors,

    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int len = bits.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < len-1;){
            if(bits[i] == 0){
                i+=1;
                continue;
            }
            if(bits[i] == 1){
                if(i == len-2){
                    //invalid if last is 1
                    return false;
                }
                i+=2;
                continue;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
