## 1196. How Many Apples Can You Put into the Basket

<pre>
You have some apples, where arr[i] is the weight of the i-th apple.  
You also have a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.

Return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [100,200,150,1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]
Output: 5
Explanation: The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose any 5 of them.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^3
</pre>

                if(j < arr[i-1]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];

                else{
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], 1 + dp[i-1][j-arr[i-1]]);
                }
            }
        }
