## 1215. Stepping Numbers
<pre>
A Stepping Number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 
1. For example, 321 is a Stepping Number while 421 is not.

Given two integers low and high, find and return a sorted list of all the Stepping Numbers in the range [low, high] inclusive.

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 0, high = 21
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,21]
 

Constraints:

0 <= low <= high <= 2 * 10^9

            note: if(d > 0) needs to be before if(d < 9)
                  this is to make sure that smaller numbers
                  go first to the queue.
                  
                  this is also important for the final result
                  to be sorted.
            */

                q.push(u*10+d-1);
            }
            if(d < 9){
                q.push(u*10+d+1);
            }
        }
        return res;
