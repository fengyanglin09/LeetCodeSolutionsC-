## 265. Paint House II
<pre>
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. 
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. 
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; 
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... 
Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5. 
Follow up:
Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

### Solution2
```c++
/*
DP solution

The first solution has O(nk^2) time complexity. 
This is because calculating the new value for each of the O(nâ‹…k) cells 
required looking at each of the k cells in the row immediately below.

However, we don't need to look at the entire previous row for every cell. 
Let's look again at the large example from above. 
When we're calculating the values for the second row, we're adding the minimum from the first row onto them. 
The only cell we can't do this for is the one that was directly below the minimum, as this would break the adjacency rule.
For this one, it makes sense to add the second minimum.
T(n) = O(nk)
S(n) = O(k)
