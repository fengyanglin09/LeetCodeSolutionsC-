## 465. Optimal Account Balancing
<pre>
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. 
Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. 
Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
Example 1:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.

## Solutions

### Solution1
```c++
/*
The trick of this problem is to be clear about the requirements
1. it does not matter who gives money to who, we just care about no one owes or paied money
i.e., 1. if some one gives user A 10 dollors, then A's balance is 10, 
      2. if user B gives some one 10 dollors, then B's balance is -10
      3. we do not care exactly who gave money to A, or who B gave money to,
         we just let A pay 10 dollors to B so that everyone has balance zero. 
         
The problem can be solved using recurssion once the above points are understood.
