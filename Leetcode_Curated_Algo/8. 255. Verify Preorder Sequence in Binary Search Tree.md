## 255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree
<pre>
Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Consider the following binary search tree: 

     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
Example 1:

Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
Follow up:
Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

## Solutions

### Solution2
```c++
/*
In this solution, the space complexity is O(1)
*/
class Solution {
public:
    bool verifyPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
        int mins = INT_MIN, top = -1;
        int n = preorder.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int v = preorder[i];
            if(v < mins){return false;}
            while(top > -1 && v > preorder[top]){
                mins = preorder[top--];
            }
            preorder[++top] = v;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Solution1

```c++
/*
The idea is that
the preorder traversal will visit the current node, then its left subtree, then its right subtree,
And the tree in the problem statement is a binary search tree. 
So, assume we can first put all node in preorder traversal in a datastructure and remove 
the tree node one by one from left subtree to right subtree. Then when a node is removed, there 
should not be any larger node still remain in the datastructre that has not been romoved. 

To sum up:
1. we put all nodes into a data structure (stack) and remove tree node one at a time
2. the order of the tree nodes to be removed is from small to large
3. therefore, when a node A is removed, there should not be any larger node still remain in the data structure

The trick is how to remove tree nodes from small to large.

class Solution {
public:
    bool verifyPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
        stack<int> seen;
        int mins = INT_MIN;
        for(auto v : preorder){
            if(v < mins){return false;}
            while(!seen.empty()&& v > seen.top()){
                mins = seen.top();
                seen.pop();
            }
            seen.push(v);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
