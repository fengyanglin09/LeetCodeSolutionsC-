## 259. 3Sum Smaller
<pre>
Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target, 
find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2,0,1]
[-2,0,3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0], target = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
0 <= n <= 300
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
-100 <= target <= 100
</pre>

## Solutions

/*
Question1: Can we use sorting to solve the problem?

we need to take care of (i < j < k) condition such that nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

Lets nums = {4, 6, 1, 9, 3, 5, 2};
sorted nums = {1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 9};
target = 6

So our answer should contain triplets with condition ( i < j < k) : {1, 3, 2} -> from nums arr

If we find same in sorted array we will get triplet without condition ( i < j < k) : {1, 2, 3} -> from sorted nums arr

In both case we will have same triplets only order will be different.
So to count only number of triplet instead printing the triplets, the condition ( i < j < k) is of no use.

Question2: can it be converted to finding two numbers? Yes,

Let us try sorting the array first. For example, nums = [3,5,2,8,1]nums=[3,5,2,8,1] becomes [1,2,3,5,8][1,2,3,5,8].

Let us look at an example nums = [1,2,3,5,8]nums=[1,2,3,5,8], and target = 7target=7.

[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
 ↑           ↑
left       right
Let us initialize two indices, leftleft and rightright pointing to the first and last element respectively.

When we look at the sum of first and last element, it is 1 + 8 = 91+8=9, which is \geq target≥target. That tells us no index pair 
will ever contain the index rightright. So the next logical step is to move the right pointer one step to its left.

[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
 ↑        ↑
left    right
Now the pair sum is 1 + 5 = 61+5=6, which is < target<target. How many pairs with one of the index = leftindex=left that 
satisfy the condition? You can tell by the difference between rightright and leftleft which is 33, namely (1,2), (1,3),(1,2),(1,3), and (1,5)(1,5).
Therefore, we move leftleft one step to its right.
