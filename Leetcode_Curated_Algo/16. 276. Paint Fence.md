## 276. Paint Fence
<pre>
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Note:
n and k are non-negative integers.

Example:

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Take c1 as color 1, c2 as color 2. All possible ways are:

            post1  post2  post3      
 -----      -----  -----  -----       
   1         c1     c1     c2 
   2         c1     c2     c1 
   3         c1     c2     c2 
   4         c2     c1     c1  
   5         c2     c1     c2
   6         c2     c2     c1

## Solutions
### Solution2
```c++
/*
Analysis:
there are n posts and k colors, 
let w be the # of ways to paint the posts s.t. at most 2 adjacent posts may have same color
then:
w0 = 0, if n = 0
w1 = k, if n = 1
w2 = (k*(k-1)) + (k*1) = k*k, which is # of way if 2nd post is diff color of 1st post + 
                                       # of way if 2nd post is same collor of 1st post, if n = 2
                                      
w3 = w2*(k-1) + (k*(k-1))*1, which is # of way if 3rd post is diff color of 2nd post + 
                                      # of way if 3rd post is same collor of 2nd post, if n = 3

The above formula is based on the fact that: 
1. if the 3rd post has diff color of its previous adajcent post, 
then # of ways to paint is # of ways if n=2 times # of colors can be chosen for the 3rd post.

2. if the 3rd post has same color of its previous adajacent post,
then the previous two posts must have different color, and there can be only 1 color for the 3rd post.

 T(n) = O(n)                                      
 S(1) = O(1)
