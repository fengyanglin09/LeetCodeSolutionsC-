## 1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village

<pre>
There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it. 
The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents 
the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000
wells.length == n
0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
1 <= pipes.length <= 10000
1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n
0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5
pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]
</pre>

## Solutions
### Solution1
```c++
/*
1. every node has a cost for build wall,
2. there is a cost to go from one house to another
3. gvien an edge, the question is how to minimize the cost by either build two walls or 
one wall and one connection. The bottom line is to make sure all houses have water

idea
1. set a virtual node 0, and use this node to connect to all the other nodes with cost the same as
   the cost for digging a well
2. it is important to connect node 0 to ALL the nodes, because some nodes may not be connected to other
   nodes, in which case, we will have to dig well for that node
3. it is important to create one and only one virtual nodes, because if more virtual nodes are introduced
   union-find will try to connect all nodes, which will introduce unnecessry costs
   
T(n) = O(mlgn), where lgn is for union-find, m is # of edges (operations)
