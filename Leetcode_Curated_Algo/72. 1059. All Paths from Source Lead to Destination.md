## 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination
<pre>
Given the edges of a directed graph where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates there is an edge between nodes ai and bi, 
and two nodes source and destination of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from source eventually, end at destination, that is:

At least one path exists from the source node to the destination node
If a path exists from the source node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to destination.
The number of possible paths from source to destination is a finite number.
Return true if and only if all roads from source lead to destination.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.
Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
Example 3:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true
Example 4:


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but there are an infinite number of paths, 
such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.
Example 5:


Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1],[1,1]], source = 0, destination = 1
Output: false
Explanation: There is infinite self-loop at destination node.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104
0 <= edges.length <= 104
edges.length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
0 <= source <= n - 1
0 <= destination <= n - 1
The given graph may have self-loops and parallel edges.

## Solutions
### Solution1
```c++
/*
idea is to use dfs

case1: false, if the destination has out going edge (bc all paths should end at destination)
case2: false, if there a cycle
case3: false, if ended up at a node not the destination and having no out going edges

case4: if traveling to a node, and the node can lead to the destination, then just return true
example:  let s be source, d be destination
          s -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> d (first search, found destination and back track)
          s -> 2 -> 1 (can stop here because destination can be reached via 1 from the search above) -> .......


question? how to determine that all the nodes are on the path from source to destination and all of them can reach 
the destination?

If all the outgoing edges from any node on the path from source can reach destination, then we can say that all
paths starting from source end at destination.
