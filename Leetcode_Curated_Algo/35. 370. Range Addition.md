## 370. Range Addition
<pre>
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:

Input: length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]
Output: [-2,0,3,5,3]
Explanation:

Initial state:
[0,0,0,0,0]

After applying operation [1,3,2]:
[0,2,2,2,0]

After applying operation [2,4,3]:
[0,2,5,5,3]

After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
[-2,0,3,5,3]

</pre>

## Solutions

### Solution1
```c++
/*
The idea is to use accumulative sum:
given int array A of size n, the accumulative sum (ASum):
Asum[0] = A[0];
Asum[1] = Asum[0] + A[1];
Asum[2] = Asum[1] + A[2];
Asum[3] = Asum[2] + A[3];
.......
Asum[n] = Asum[n-1] + A[n];

Algorithm (Assuming all eles in A are the same):

1. for each update query (i, j, val) on array A, we need:
    a. update start position: A[i] = A[i] + val
    b. update 1 position after end position: A[j+1] = A[j+1] + val;
    
2. In final transformation, The accumulative sum of the entire array is taken (as explained above)


Analysis of correctness:
For each update query (i, j, val) on the array arrarr, 
the goal is to achieve the result:

A[k] = A[k] + val  ∀  k ∈ [i,j]

Applying the final transformation, ensures two things:
1. it carries over the the +val increment over to every element k, ∀ k >= i
2. the increasement +val was compensated by -val ro every element h, ∀  h > j

The net outcome:
A[k] = A[k] + val,  ∀  k ∈ [i,j]
A[h] = A[h] + val - val, ∀  h ∈ (j,n]


---------------------------------

More to the thinking:

The above algorithm works only if all elements in A are equal, what if in the case where eles in A are not equal?

ans: 
1. make another array B of same size and all 0 elements
2. apply the above algorithm to B
3. add the corresponding values from B to A 


--------------------------------------------

Analysis:
T(n) = O(k + n), where k is # of operations and n is the time for calculate accumulative sum
