## 296. Best Meeting Point
<pre>
A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. 
You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group. 
The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

Example:

Input: 

1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 6 

Explanation: Given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):
             The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance 
             of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.

## Solutions

### Solution1
```c++
/*
Solution1: BFS
in this problem, there are multiple start points and the objective is to find the point
with the minimum distance to the start points. Two options:
1. start from the start points and bfs to find the point.
2. try every point and bfs to find the point with min distance to the all start points.

if # of start points are given, fixed and small, then we should consider option1
if # of start points is unkown, then we should consider option2

In this problem, we should consider option 2

Analysis:
T(n) = O(m*n *  m*n) = O(m^2 * n^2), this is bc there are m*n nodes and each search will search m*n nodes in the worest case

will cause TLE
