## 493. Reverse Pairs

Given an array nums, we call (i, j) an important reverse pair if i < j and nums[i] > 2*nums[j].

You need to return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array.

<pre>
Example1:
Input: [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2

Example2:
Input: [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3

Note:
The length of the given array will not exceed 50,000.
All the numbers in the input array are in the range of 32-bit integer.

#### Method2: Merge Sort
```c++

/*
Method2: Embedded Merge Sorting

Assumption1
Assuming: an integer array A can be evenly divided into two half: B, C;
          and eles in B and C are sorted in ascending order. Then if i in B and j in C
          are reverse pair, all the eles in B after i must also be reverse pair with j in C.

For example: let A = {5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4}, where B = {5,6,7,8}, C = {1,2,3,4}, then
             because 5 in B and 1 in C are reverse pair, all other eles in B after 5: 6,7,8
             must also be reverse pairs with 1 in C.

Claim: Merge Sort process can be used with the above described process to find the # of reverse pairs

proof of the above claim:

Let A be an integer array and elements in A are not sorted. The merge sort takes mainly two steps:
step1: divide-A is devided evenly in half recurssively, until there is only one element so can not be divided further
step2: merge the devided two halves at each recursive stack level. Note at each recursive level, both left half and 
       right half must be sorted.
       
Therefore, we can find the reverse pairs during the merge process of left and right halves. 

Now the question is: given left half l and right half r, how to find the reverse pairs?

We need to consider following facts:
fact 1. left half and right half are sorted in ascending order.
fact 2. to count total # of reverse pairs, we need to consider all reverse pairs 
        in left half, right half, and there may be pairs with one ele in left half and one in right half.
fact 3. the final merge process at the top stack of the recursive process must guarranttee the total # of reverse
        pairs be countted. Otherwise, the algorithm is not valid or does not work.

proof of fact 1:
    The proof is trival, the merge sort process guarranttees fact 1

proof of fact 2:
    The proof of fact 2 is trival, but the question is how to count the reverse pairs?
    let l be the left half and r be the right half at an arbitrary stack level of the merge sort process. Then, there
    are 0 reverse pairs in both left and right halves. This is because both l and r are sorted. Therefore, we only
    need to count the reverse pairs when one ele is from l and one ele is from r. That can be counted using the method
    from Assumption1 above.
    
proof of fact 3:
    at the top recurssive stack call, the entire arrary A is considered and the left half l and right half r at this         level will merge to an new array with the exactly the same eles in A but in ascending order. The elements in left
    half and right half are interacted in the merge process for the first time in the recurssive process. As the # of 
    reverse pairs in l and r were already counted and the only reverse pairs left must be those with one ele in l and 
    another in r. Therefore, the last merge process will guarrattee the total # of reverse pairs be countted.
