## 901. Online Stock Span

Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) 
for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

 
<pre>
Example 1:

Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

Note:

Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.
The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.

## Solutions

### Method1: Jumping Search
```c++
/*
Method1: jump to check for the correct range
The idea is:
step 1. store the #s of eles <= for the current price
step 2. to find the # in step1, we keep check the previous ele and its corresponding #


For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were 
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], 
then the stock spans would be 
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

How we check for the # for the last day in the example above?

1. let span be the # of days with price <= today's price, and span = 1 initially
2. assume there are has been n days passed at this point
step1: look at the previous day, of which price 75 <=85 and the # is 4, so span += 4, and jump to n-4 day
step2: look at n-4 day, of which price 80 <= 85 and # is 1, so span += 1, and jump to n-4-1 day
step3: look at n-4-1 day, of which price is 100 > 85, stop.

Analysis:
case1: if the prices are in ascending order, every check will jump to the beginning: T(n) = O(1)
case2: if the prcies are in descending order, every check will stop immidiately: T(n) = O(1)
case3: 
      1. if the prices are one day increase and one day decrease interleaved, 
      2. all previous prices are smaller than today's price
      3. then we first check the privous price, we may only jump 1 day then next jump 2 day, 
         or we may first jump 2 days and then 1 day, untill the very first day
      4. in the worst case: T(n) = O(n/2)

So, T(n) = O(n)
    S(n) = O(n)
