## 319. Bulb Switcher

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

Example:

Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

## My Solutions

```c++
/*
Method3: based on Method 2
the calculation in Method 2 was redundant,
this is bc all the numbers in the for loop will have pow to 2 smaller than n,
therefore, we could just use sqrt(n) for the answer
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int len = sqrt(n);
        /*
        //this part of calculation is unnecessary,
        //bc 2nd power of all i's in the for loop must be <= n
        for(int i = 1; i <= len; i++){
            if(pow(i,2) <= n){
                res++;
            }
        }
        */
        return len;
    }
};

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

```c++
/*
Method2: is based on the fact1 that:
1. bulb is "on" if it was toggled odd times, and "off" if toggled even times
2. a bulb will be toggled odd times if its number can be sqart root
    i.e., for bulb no.5, it will be toggled by 1 and 5 only (even number)
          for bulb no. 9, it will be toggled by 1, 3, 9 (odd number)

therefore the total # of bulbs to be turned on is # of bulbs with exact sqare root
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int len = sqrt(n);
        for(int i = 1; i <= len; i++){
            if(pow(i,2) <= n){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

```c++
//Method1: brute force, TLE, pass 27/35 cases
//T(n) = O(n)
//S(n) = O(n)
class Solution {

        //1-"on", 0-"off"
        vector<int> bulbs(n+1,0);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = i; j <=n; j++){
                if(j%i==0){
                    bulbs[j]++;
                }
            }
