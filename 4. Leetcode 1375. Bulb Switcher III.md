# 1375. Bulb Switcher III
Medium

There is a room with n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment k (for k from 0 to n - 1), we turn on the light[k] bulb. A bulb change color to blue only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue.

 

Example 1:
![](https://github.com/fengyanglin09/LeetCodeSolutionsC-/blob/master/images/Leetcode1375.%20Bulb%20Switcher%20III.png)


Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.
Example 2:

Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).
Example 3:

Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.
Example 4:

Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
Output: 3
Example 5:

Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

n == light.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
light is a permutation of  [1, 2, ..., n]


----------------------------------------------
My Solutions:
```c++
/*
the idea is to use hash map to record the index and the lights being turned on
0. use a hash set S to record the lights being turned on
1. also use a variable to record the rightmost light being turned on
2. use a pointer A to the begining of the lights
3. advance A if the bulb A is "on"
4. if A equals the rightmost being turned on, it must be in the moment in which all turned on bulbs are blue

T(n) = O(n)
S(n) = O(n)
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int numTimesAllBlue(vector<int>& light) {
        int ptr = 0;//used to indicate all previous lights on situation
        unordered_set<int> on;
        int res = 0;//result for the # of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue
        int len = light.size();
        int rightMostLight = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            on.insert(light[i]);
            rightMostLight = max(rightMostLight, light[i]);
            while(on.count(ptr+1)){
                ptr++;
            }
            if(ptr == rightMostLight){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
