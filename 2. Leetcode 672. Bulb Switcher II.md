## leetcode 672. Bulb Switcher II

There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.

Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:

Flip all the lights.
Flip lights with even numbers.
Flip lights with odd numbers.
Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, m = 1.
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
 

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, m = 1.
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
 

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, m = 1.
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
 

Note: n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].

### Analysis

The reason method 1 was causing TLE was because the time and space complexity were too large, so needed to be reduced.
How to reduced the complexities? they can be reduced if they have circles and duplicates.

How to reduce space complexity? 

let m1, m2, m3, m4 be the 4 operations performed on n bulbs:
<pre>
m1: 1~   2~   3~   4~   5~   6~  |  7~   8~   9~   10~  11~  12~  |  13~  14~  15~
m2: 1    2~   3    4~   5    6~  |  7    8~   9    10~  11   12~  |  13   14~  15
m3: 1~   2    3~   4    5~   6   |  7~   8    9~   10   11~  12   |  13~  14   15~
m4: 1~   2    3    4~   5    6   |  7~   8    9    10~  11   12   |  13~  14   15
</pre>
where
m1: flip all the lights
m2: flip lights with even numbers
m3: flip lights with odd numbers
m4: flip lights with (3K+1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
the tilde indicate the bulbs being flipped by a certain option. 
From the table above, we can clearly see a pattern that repeats very 6 bulbs for all 4 operations,
therefore the space complexity can be reduced to (n%6)+6

How to reduce time complexity?

assuming that m is big and all operations (m1,m2,m3,m4) are performed at least once, then
1. the same operation performed twice equals not performing that operation at all
2. performing m1+m2 is equivalent to performing m3
3. performing m2+m3 is equivalent to performing m1
4. performing m1+m3 is equivalent to performing m2

therefore there can only 8 possible status: null(by performing same op twice), 
                                            m1, 
                                            m2, 
                                            m3, 
                                            m4, 
                                            m1+m4, 
                                            m2+m4, 
                                            m3+m4.

from above analysis we can see that there must be many duplicated status generated/visited by the brute force method implemented below.
so, the question is how to reduce the duplicates?

1. we can run all number m of operations just like the brute force method below
2. but,we will remove duplicated solutions each iteration.


```c++
//method 2: a bfs like approach with reduced space complexity and deduplications

/*
T(n) = O(m*8), there are m operations, each operation could result in only 8 different status
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int flipLights(int n, int m) {
        ///special case-if not operations, then there will be only one status
        if(m == 0){return 1;}
        
        int len = ((n > 6)? ((n % 6) + 6) : n);
        /*
        here we use 1 for "on" and 0 for "off"
        (1 << 6) will give 1000000 in binary form, minus 1 will give 111111
        */
        int lights = (1 << len) - 1;
        unordered_set<int> res; //for results and deduplicate
        queue<int> myQ;
        myQ.push(lights);

                }
