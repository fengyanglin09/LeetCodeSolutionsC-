## 185. Department Top Three Salaries

<pre>
The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. 
For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+

### Solution 2

```sql

SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (
        SELECT COUNT(e1.Salary)+1
        FROM (
              SELECT DISTINCT e0.Salary, e0.DepartmentId
              FROM Employee e0
             ) e1
        WHERE e1.Salary > e.Salary
              AND e1.DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId
      ) <= 3
      
```
------------------------------------------------------------------
### Solution 1
```sql

# Write your MySQL query statement below

/*
idea: 
1. build t1 as join table between Employee and Department, but replace DepartmentId with Name
2. build t2 as join aggregate table based on t1, where we add aggregate column for salary rank
3. query based on t2
*/

WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT e.Id, e.Name, e.Salary, d.Name AS 'DeptName'
    FROM Employee e
    LEFT JOIN Department d
    ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
)
,
t2 AS (
    SELECT tm2.DeptName AS 'Department', tm2.Name AS 'Employee', tm2.Salary, (
                                                                    SELECT COUNT(tm1.Salary)+1
                                                                    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT t1.Salary, t1.DeptName
                                                                          FROM t1) AS tm1
                                                                    WHERE tm1.Salary > tm2.Salary
                                                                          AND tm1.DeptName = tm2.DeptName
                                                                  ) AS 'Rank'
    FROM t1 AS tm2
)

SELECT t2.Department, t2.Employee, t2.Salary
FROM t2
WHERE t2.Rank <= 3 AND t2.Department IS NOT NULL

```
