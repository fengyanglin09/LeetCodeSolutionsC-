## 1412. Find the Quiet Students in All Exams
<pre>
Table: Student

+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
 

Table: Exam

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Student with student_id got score points in exam with id exam_id.
 

A "quite" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being "quiet" in ALL exams.

Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table ordered by student_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Jade          |
| 3           | Stella        |
| 4           | Jonathan      |
| 5           | Will          |
+-------------+---------------+

Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |
| 30         |     3        |    80     |
| 30         |     4        |    90     |
| 40         |     1        |    60     |
| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+

For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exam.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
T1 AS (
SELECT e.exam_id, MAX(e.score) AS 'maxs', MIN(e.score) AS 'mins'
FROM Exam e
GROUP BY 1
)
,
T2 AS (
SELECT e.student_id
FROM Exam e LEFT JOIN T1 t1
ON e.exam_id = t1.exam_id
WHERE e.score = t1.maxs OR e.score = t1.mins
)
,
T3 AS(
SELECT DISTINCT e.student_id
FROM Exam e
WHERE e.student_id NOT IN (SELECT * FROM T2)
)
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name 
FROM T3 t3 LEFT JOIN Student s
ON t3.student_id = s.student_id
