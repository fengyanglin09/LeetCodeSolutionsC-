## 1179. Reformat Department Table

<pre>
Table: Department

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| revenue       | int     |
| month         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

The query result format is in the following example:

Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+

Result table:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT
    DISTINCT id,
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Jan" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Jan_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Feb" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Feb_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Mar" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Mar_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Apr" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Apr_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "May" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'May_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Jun" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Jun_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Jul" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Jul_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Aug" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Aug_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Sep" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Sep_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Oct" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Oct_Revenue',    
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Nov" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Nov_Revenue',
    (SELECT SUM(d0.revenue) FROM Department d0 WHERE d0.month = "Dec" AND d0.id = d.id) AS 'Dec_Revenue'
                        
FROM Department d

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT
    id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Jan" THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Feb" THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Mar" THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Apr" THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,

    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Oct" THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Nov" THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE month WHEN "Dec" THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id
