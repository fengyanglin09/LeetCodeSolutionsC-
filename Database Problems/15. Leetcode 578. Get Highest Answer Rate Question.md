## 578. Get Highest Answer Rate Question

<pre>
Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: id, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

id means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; 
answer_id is not null when action column is "answer", while is null for "show" and "skip"; 
q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input:
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| id   | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.
 

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number's ratio in show number in the same question.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH Tmp1 AS (
SELECT s.question_id, COUNT(question_id) AS 'CountQ', (SELECT COUNT(*) 
                                               FROM survey_log s0
                                               WHERE s0.question_id = s.question_id
                                                     AND s0.action = 'answer') AS 'CountA'
     FROM survey_log s
     GROUP BY s.question_id
)
,
Tmp2 AS(
SELECT t.question_id AS survey_log, (t.CountA/t.CountQ) AS 'Ratio'
FROM Tmp1 t
)

SELECT t.survey_log

                 SELECT MAX(t1.Ratio)
                 FROM Tmp2 t1
