## 626. Exchange Seats

<pre>

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

## Solutions

### Solution2
```sql
/*
Bit manipulation expression (id+1)^1-1 can calculate the new id after switch.

SELECT id, (id+1)^1-1, student FROM seat;
| id | (id+1)^1-1 | student |
|----|------------|---------|
| 1  | 2          | Abbot   |
| 2  | 1          | Doris   |
| 3  | 4          | Emerson |
| 4  | 3          | Green   |
| 5  | 6          | Jeames  |
Then, we can make a temp table and join seat with this table like below.

SELECT
    *
FROM
    seat s1
        LEFT JOIN
    seat s2 ON (s1.id+1)^1-1 = s2.id
ORDER BY s1.id;
| id | student | id | student |
|----|---------|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   | 2  | Doris   |
| 2  | Doris   | 1  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Emerson | 4  | Green   |
| 4  | Green   | 3  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |    |         |
Note:The first two columns are from s1 and the last two are from s2.

At last, we can output s1.id and s2.student. 
However, the s2.student is NULL for seat id '5' but s1.student is right. 
Thus, we we can use function COALESCE() to generate the correct output for the last record.
*/

SELECT
    s1.id, COALESCE(s2.student, s1.student) AS student
FROM
    seat s1
        LEFT JOIN
    seat s2 ON ((s1.id + 1) ^ 1) - 1 = s2.id
ORDER BY s1.id;

```

### Solution1

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
Idea is straightforward:
we swap id, 
if last row and id is odd, then do not change id
if not last row and id is odd, then id = id+1
if id is even, then id = id-1
*/

SELECT (
        CASE
        WHEN s.id%2 != 0 AND s.id = s1.last THEN s.id
        WHEN s.id%2 != 0 AND s.id != s1.last THEN s.id+1
        WHEN s.id%2 = 0 THEN s.id-1
        END
       ) AS 'id', student
FROM seat s, (SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'last' FROM seat) s1
ORDER BY id

```
