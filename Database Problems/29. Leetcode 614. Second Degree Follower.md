## 614. Second Degree Follower

<pre>
In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
 

 

Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.

## Solution

### Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
idea:
The trick of this question is that the question is asking the # of followers for a follower
Therefore, the subject under consideration must be a follower first

Note: The table may contain duplicate rows, i.e.,
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
*/

SELECT f.followee AS 'follower', COUNT(DISTINCT f.follower) AS 'num'
FROM follow f
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follow f1 WHERE f1.follower = f.followee) > 0 
        AND f.follower != f.followee
GROUP BY f.followee
ORDER BY f.followee

```
