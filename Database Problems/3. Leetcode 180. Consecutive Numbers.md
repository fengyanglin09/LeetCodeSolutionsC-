## 180. Consecutive Numbers

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
<pre>
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

## Solution 1

```sql

# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
The idea is to join table three times
*/

SELECT DISTINCT a.Num AS 'ConsecutiveNums'
FROM Logs a, Logs b, Logs c
WHERE a.Num = b.Num 
      AND b.Num = c.Num
      AND a.Id+1 = b.Id
      AND b.Id+1 = c.Id

```
