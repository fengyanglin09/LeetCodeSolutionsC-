## 1097. Game Play Analysis V
<pre>
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, 
divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00

```sql
WITH t AS 
(
SELECT a.player_id, install_dt, CASE WHEN event_date IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS Day1_retention 
FROM 
(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS install_dt
    FROM activity 
    GROUP BY 1) a
    
    LEFT JOIN Activity b
    ON a.player_id = b.player_id AND a.install_dt + INTERVAL 1 DAY = b.event_date
)    

SELECT install_dt, COUNT(player_id) AS installs, round(AVG(Day1_retention), 2) AS Day1_retention
FROM t
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

```

### Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

/*
step1 find player_id and their install date from Activity table, in T1
*/

/*
step2 find # of players installed game and # of players logged back on that day from T1 and Activit table
*/

WITH T1 AS # get install date for each player
(
SELECT a.player_id, MIN(a.event_date) AS 'Install_Date'
FROM Activity a
GROUP BY a.player_id
)
,
T2 AS # get num of players instaing on on a perticular day
(
SELECT t1.Install_Date, COUNT(t1.player_id) AS 'Player_Counts'
FROM T1 t1
GROUP BY t1.Install_Date
)
,
T3 AS
(
SELECT t.Install_Date, SUM(IF(a.event_date IS NULL,0,1)) AS 'Return_Counts'
#SELECT *
FROM T1 t LEFT JOIN Activity a ON t.player_id = a.player_id AND DATEDIFF(t.Install_Date, a.event_date) = -1
GROUP BY t.Install_Date
)

SELECT t2.Install_Date AS 'install_dt', t2.Player_Counts AS 'installs', ROUND(t3.Return_Counts/t2.Player_Counts, 2) AS 'Day1_retention'
FROM T2 t2 LEFT JOIN T3 t3 ON t2.Install_Date = t3.Install_Date
ORDER BY t2.Install_Date
