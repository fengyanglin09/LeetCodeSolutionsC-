## 569. Median Employee Salary

<pre>
The Employee table holds all employees. 
The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.

+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |

Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. 
Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

### Solution 2
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

/*
Idea is to use ascending and discending order ranks
The ASC[i] and DESC[i] be any index of any given array in ascending and descending order, then 
i is the index of median iff ASC[i] is in DESC[i] - 1 AND DESC[i] + 1

For example: 
case 1:
let a given array A of size 9 (odd size) be sorted in ascending and discending orders and the indices:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  -  ascending order
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  -  discending order
Then the only index satisfying above definition is 5

case 2:
let a given array A of size 8 (even size) be sorted in ascending and discending orders and the indices:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  -  ascending order
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  -  discending order
Then the only indices satisfying above definition are 4 and 5

  with t as (
  select id, Company, Salary, 
  row_number() over( partition by Company order by Salary asc, id asc) rnk_asc,
  row_number() over( partition by Company order by Salary desc, id desc) rnk_desc    
  from Employee
  )
  select id, Company, Salary
  from t
  where rnk_asc between rnk_desc -1 and  rnk_desc +1
  order by Company, Salary;

### Solution 1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
The idea is to use the definition of median:
Let A be the numerical array of length n,
1. if n is odd, then the median is the ith ele A[i], s.t. # of eles in A smaller than A[i] must equal to #
of eles in A greater than A[i]

2. if n is even, then the median is the middle two eles A[i], A[i+1], s.t. The difference in # of eles in A smaller than
A[i] and # of eles in A greater than A[i] must be one. The same applys to A[i+1]

Therefore, the difference in # of eles greater than the median and # of eles smaller than the median can not be greater than one. At the same time, the count of elements with the same value as the median must be at least one. 

From above observation, we can conclude that: # of counts of elements with the same value as median must be greater than
or equal to the difference in # of eles greater than the median and # of eles smaller than the median

In the query, we only need to find eles that meet the above condition.
