## 1517. Find Users With Valid E-Mails

<pre>
Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| mail          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information of the users signed up in a website. Some e-mails are invalid.
 

Write an SQL query to find the users who have valid emails.

A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where: 

The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.' and/or dash '-'. 
The prefix name must start with a letter.
The domain is '@leetcode.com'.
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Users
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 2       | Jonathan  | jonathanisgreat         |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
| 5       | Marwan    | quarz#2020@leetcode.com |
| 6       | David     | david69@gmail.com       |
| 7       | Shapiro   | .shapo@leetcode.com     |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+

Result table:
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
The mail of user 2 doesn't have a domain.
The mail of user 5 has # sign which is not allowed.
The mail of user 6 doesn't have leetcode domain.
The mail of user 7 starts with a period.

## Solutions
### Solution1

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

/*
^[A-Za-z] the first character must be a letter. after that...
[A-Za-z0-9_.-]* match any number of letters, numbers, underscore, periods, dashes (the * sign indicating "any number of, including zero"). after that...
@leetcode.com$ the email must end with exactly "@leetcode.com" (the $ sign indicating "ending with")

Note that the escape characters are not strictly necessary. This means that the backslash ( \ ) symbol that precedes the period, dash, etc is not needed here. I've left them in because it's what I'm accustomed to. I don't know why exactly MySQL does not require them, but so it is.

Also note that, since SQL is not case sensitive generally, it's also not necessary to include both uppercase and lowercase letters (ie one could just as easily use [A-Z] instead of [A-Za-z]. Again, I've included them because outside of SQL that would be necessary.

SELECT *
FROM Users u
WHERE u.mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\_\.\-]*@leetcode.com$'
