Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

The query result format is in the following example:

Return result table ordered by visited_on.

average_amount should be rounded to 2 decimal places, all dates are in the format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |

| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+

1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

### Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH T1 AS(
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY c.visited_on) AS 'id', c.visited_on, SUM(c.amount) AS 'amount'
FROM Customer c
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 2
)
,
T2 AS(
SELECT @sum := 0
)
SELECT t1.visited_on, 
@sum := (SELECT SUM(t11.amount) FROM T1 t11 WHERE t11.id BETWEEN t1.id-6 AND t1.id) AS 'amount',
ROUND(@sum/7,2) AS 'average_amount'
FROM T1 t1 JOIN T2 t2
WHERE t1.id >= 7
ORDER BY 1
```
