## 1369. Get the Second Most Recent Activity
<pre>
Table: UserActivity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| username      | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
| startDate     | Date    |
| endDate       | Date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table does not contain primary key.
This table contain information about the activity performed of each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed a activity from startDate to endDate.

Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. 

A user can't perform more than one activity at the same time. Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH T1 AS(
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY u.username ORDER BY u.startDate DESC) AS 'id',
u.username, u.activity, u.startDate, u.endDate,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM UserActivity u0 WHERE u0.username = u.username) AS 'counts'
FROM UserActivity u
)

SELECT t1.username AS 'USERNAME', t1.activity AS 'ACTIVITY', t1.startDate AS 'STARTDATE', t1.endDate AS 'ENDDATE'
FROM T1 t1
WHERE (t1.counts >= 2 AND t1.id = 2) OR (t1.counts < 2 AND t1.id = 1)
```
