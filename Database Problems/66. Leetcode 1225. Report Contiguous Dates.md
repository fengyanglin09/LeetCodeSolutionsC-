## 1225. Report Contiguous Dates
<pre>
Table: Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is fail_date.
Failed table contains the days of failed tasks.
Table: Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is success_date.
Succeeded table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Order result by start_date.

The query result format is in the following example:

Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+

Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+


Result table:
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+

The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and system state was "succeeded".

## Solutions

### Solution1

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
The idea is that for difference between days and their corresponding row_numbers should be the same if the days are consecutive
i.e.,
1, 2019-12-06   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
2, 2019-12-07   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
3, 2019-12-08   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
4, 2019-12-09   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
5, 2018-12-09   (has to be consecutive if the year is 2019 and sorted in ascending order)
6, 2019-12-11   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
7, 2019-12-12   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
8, 2019-12-13   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference
9, 2019-12-14   ->   2019-12-05 as their difference

The trick is:
1. we need to make sure only the days in the same year are selected
2. we need to make sure row numbers are added based on the dates in ascending order

WITH T1 AS(
SELECT 'failed' AS 'status', f.fail_date AS 'date', 
DAYOFYEAR(f.fail_date) - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY f.fail_date) AS 'diff' 
FROM Failed f
WHERE YEAR(f.fail_date) = 2019
UNION
SELECT 'succeeded' AS 'status', s.success_date AS 'date',
DAYOFYEAR(s.success_date) - ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY s.success_date) AS 'diff'
FROM Succeeded s
WHERE YEAR(s.success_date) = 2019
)

SELECT t.status AS 'period_state', MIN(t.date) AS 'start_date', MAX(t.date) AS 'end_date'
FROM T1 t
GROUP BY t.status, t.diff
ORDER BY 2
