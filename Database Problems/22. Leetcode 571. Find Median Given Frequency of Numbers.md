## 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

<pre>

The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

## Solution

## Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

/*
The idea is that Median must be having count more than the absolute difference between count of eles smaller than the Median and 
count of eles greater than the Median
*/


SELECT SUM(n.Number)/COUNT(n.Number) AS 'median'
FROM Numbers n
WHERE n.Frequency >= (SELECT ABS(SUM(
                                CASE
                                WHEN (n1.number - n.number) > 0 THEN 1
                                WHEN (n1.number - n.number) < 0 THEN -1
                                ELSE 0
                                END
                                * n1.Frequency
                                ) )
                       FROM Numbers n1)

```
