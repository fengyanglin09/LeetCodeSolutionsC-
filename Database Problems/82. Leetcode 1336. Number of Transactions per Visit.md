## 1336. Number of Transactions per Visit
<pre>
Table: Visits

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, visit_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has visited the bank in visit_date.
 

Table: Transactions

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)
 

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions bank visitors did in one visit to the bank and 
the corresponding number of visitors who have done this number of transaction in one visit.

Write an SQL query to find how many users visited the bank and didn't do any transactions, how many visited the bank and did one transaction and so on.

The result table will contain two columns:

transactions_count which is the number of transactions done in one visit.
visits_count which is the corresponding number of users who did transactions_count in one visit to the bank.
transactions_count should take all values from 0 to max(transactions_count) done by one or more users.

Order the result table by transactions_count.

The query result format is in the following example:

Visits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-01-01 |
| 2       | 2020-01-02 |
| 12      | 2020-01-01 |
| 19      | 2020-01-03 |
| 1       | 2020-01-02 |
| 2       | 2020-01-03 |
| 1       | 2020-01-04 |
| 7       | 2020-01-11 |
| 9       | 2020-01-25 |
| 8       | 2020-01-28 |
+---------+------------+
Transactions table:
+---------+------------------+--------+
| user_id | transaction_date | amount |
+---------+------------------+--------+
| 1       | 2020-01-02       | 120    |
| 2       | 2020-01-03       | 22     |
| 7       | 2020-01-11       | 232    |
| 1       | 2020-01-04       | 7      |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 33     |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 66     |
| 8       | 2020-01-28       | 1      |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 99     |
+---------+------------------+--------+
Result table:
+--------------------+--------------+
| transactions_count | visits_count |
+--------------------+--------------+
| 0                  | 4            |
| 1                  | 5            |
| 2                  | 0            |
| 3                  | 1            |
+--------------------+--------------+
* For transactions_count = 0, The visits (1, "2020-01-01"), (2, "2020-01-02"), (12, "2020-01-01") and (19, "2020-01-03") did no transactions so visits_count = 4.
* For transactions_count = 1, The visits (2, "2020-01-03"), (7, "2020-01-11"), (8, "2020-01-28"), (1, "2020-01-02") and (1, "2020-01-04") did one transaction so visits_count = 5.
* For transactions_count = 2, No customers visited the bank and did two transactions so visits_count = 0.
* For transactions_count = 3, The visit (9, "2020-01-25") did three transactions so visits_count = 1.
* For transactions_count >= 4, No customers visited the bank and did more than three transactions so we will stop at transactions_count = 3

## Solutions
### Solution1
```sql
/*
The tricky part of this problem is that
There may be entres in Transacation table with dates that never recorded
in the visit table.

*/

WITH RECURSIVE
T1 AS(
SELECT v.user_id, v.visit_date, t.amount
FROM Visits v LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.user_id = t.user_id AND v.visit_date = t.transaction_date
)
,
zero AS(
SELECT 0 AS 'trans', COUNT(*) AS 'ppl'
FROM T1 t1
WHERE t1.amount IS NULL
)
,
T2 AS(
SELECT t1.user_id, t1.visit_date, COUNT(*) AS 'trans'
FROM T1 t1
WHERE t1.amount IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2
)
,
others AS(
SELECT t2.trans, COUNT(*) as 'ppl'
FROM T2 t2
GROUP BY 1
)
,
alls AS(
SELECT *
FROM zero z
UNION
SELECT *
FROM others o
)
,
tmp AS(
SELECT @max := (SELECT MAX(trans) FROM alls)
)
,
ids AS(
SELECT 0 AS 'n'
UNION
SELECT n+1
FROM ids JOIN tmp
WHERE n+1 <= @max
)
SELECT i.n AS 'transactions_count', IFNULL(a.ppl,0) AS 'visits_count'
