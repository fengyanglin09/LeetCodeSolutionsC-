## 178. Rank Scores

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. 
In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks

<pre>
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
Important Note: For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. 
For example `Rank`.

## Solution 2
```c++

/*
same idea, but use with clause
*/

WITH tmp AS (SELECT Score, Id, (SELECT COUNT(s1.Score)+1 
                                FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Score
                                      FROM Scores) AS s1 
                                WHERE s1.Score > s0.Score) AS 'Rank'
             FROM Scores AS s0)
             
SELECT t.Score, t.Rank
FROM tmp t
ORDER BY t.Score DESC

```

## Solution 1

```c++
/*
idea is to create a column for rank
*/

SELECT score, (SELECT COUNT(score)+1 
               FROM (SELECT DISTINCT score 
                     FROM Scores) s1 
                     WHERE s0.score < s1.score) AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores s0
ORDER BY s0.score DESC;

```
