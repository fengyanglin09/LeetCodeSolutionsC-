## 1050. Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times

<pre>
Table: ActorDirector

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key column for this table.
 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor have cooperated with the director at least 3 times.

Example:

ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.

SELECT a.actor_id, a.director_id
FROM ActorDirector a 
GROUP BY a.actor_id, a.director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 #note this count is for the group rows
```

### Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_id AS 'actor_id', a.director_id AS 'director_id'
FROM ActorDirector a
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
       ActorDirector a1 WHERE a1.actor_id = a.actor_id 
                        AND a1.director_id = a.director_id ) >= 3
```
