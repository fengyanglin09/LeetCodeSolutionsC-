## 603. Consecutive Available Seats
sss
<pre>
Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

## Solutions
### Solution2
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
Idea, two seats are consecutive iff
1. both are available
2. the difference of their seat numbers can not be more than 1
*/

SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1 JOIN cinema c2
ON ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1
AND c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1
ORDER BY seat_id
```
--------------------------------------------------
### Solution1
```sql
SELECT seat_id
FROM cinema c0
WHERE c0.free = 1 AND
(EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cinema c1 WHERE c1.seat_id = c0.seat_id-1 AND c1.free = 1)
OR EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cinema c1 WHERE c1.seat_id = c0.seat_id+1 AND c1.free = 1))
ORDER BY seat_id ASC
```
