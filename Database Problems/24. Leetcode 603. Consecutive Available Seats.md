## 603. Consecutive Available Seats


Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

<pre>

 | seat_id | free |
 |---------|------|
 | 1       | 1    |
 | 2       | 0    |
 | 3       | 1    |
 | 4       | 1    |
 | 5       | 1    |
</pre> 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

<pre> 
 | seat_id |
 |---------|
 | 3       |
 | 4       |
 | 5       |
 </pre>
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
Idea, two seats are consecutive iff
1. both are available
2. the difference of their seat numbers can not be more than 1
*/

SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1 JOIN cinema c2
ON ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1
AND c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1
ORDER BY seat_id
```

### Solution1
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT seat_id
FROM cinema c0
WHERE c0.free = 1 AND
(EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cinema c1 WHERE c1.seat_id = c0.seat_id-1 AND c1.free = 1)
OR EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cinema c1 WHERE c1.seat_id = c0.seat_id+1 AND c1.free = 1))
ORDER BY seat_id ASC
```
