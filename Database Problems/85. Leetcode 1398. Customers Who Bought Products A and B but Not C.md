| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| customer_id         | int     |

| Column Name   | Type    |

| order_id      | int     |

| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the id of the customer who bought the product "product_name".
 

Write an SQL query to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products "A", "B" 
but did not buy the product "C" since we want to recommend them buy this product.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id.

The query result format is in the following example.
