## 618. Students Report By Geography

<pre>
A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. 
The students' location information are stored in table student as below.
 

| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |
 

Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically 
and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, 
Asia and Europe respectively. 

It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.
 

For the sample input, the output is:
 

| America | Asia | Europe |
|---------|------|--------|
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    |      |        |
 
</pre>

## Solutions

### Solution1
```sql

# Write your MySQL query statement below
/*
The idea is to use session variable. The example of session variable usage 
is shown in the query example below:

SELECT 
    row_id, row_id1, row_id2, America
FROM
    (SELECT @am:=0, @pm:=0, @mm:=0) t,
    (SELECT 
        @am:=@am + 1 AS 'row_id', @pm:=@pm - 1 AS 'row_id1', @mm:=@mm + 2 AS 'row_id2', name AS America
    FROM
        student
    WHERE
        continent = 'America'
    ORDER BY America) AS t2
;


Another thing to note is that the problem states that:
"It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe."
So, we will need outer join
*/


WITH
T AS (SELECT @as := 0, @am := 0, @eu := 0),
T1 AS(
SELECT tmp.id AS 'id', tmp.America AS 'America'
FROM T,
     (SELECT @am := @am+1 AS 'id', s.name AS 'America'
      FROM student s
      WHERE s.continent = 'America'
      ORDER BY s.name
     ) tmp
)
,
T2 AS(
SELECT tmp.id AS 'id', tmp.Asia AS 'Asia'
FROM T,
     (SELECT @as := @as+1 AS 'id', s.name AS 'Asia'
      FROM student s
      WHERE s.continent = 'Asia'
      ORDER BY s.name
     ) tmp
)
,
T3 AS(
SELECT tmp.id AS 'id', tmp.Europe AS 'Europe'
FROM T,
     (SELECT @eu := @eu+1 AS 'id', s.name AS 'Europe'
      FROM student s
      WHERE s.continent = 'Europe'
      ORDER BY s.name
     ) tmp
)

SELECT T1.America, T2.Asia, T3.Europe 
FROM (T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.id = T2.id)
LEFT JOIN T3 ON T1.id = T3.id


```
