## 759. Employee Free Time

We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. 

For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  

Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

 
<pre>
Example 1:
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

Example 2:
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
 

Constraints:
1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50
0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8
</pre>

### Solution
```c++
/*
// Definition for an Interval.
class Interval {
public:
    int start;
    int end;

    Interval() {}

    Interval(int _start, int _end) {
        start = _start;
        end = _end;
    }
};
*/

/*
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]

from above example, we can see that there are 3 people, and the first person has 2 schedules.
We can put all these schedules on a time plane to see why [3,4] is the answer:

1-------2
1---------------3
                                  5-------6
                          4-------------------------------------------10                                            

From above picture, we can see it clearly that the comment free interval is [3,4]

algorithm:
1. put all the intervals into a min-heap MH on the starting time
2. let a be the first interval in min-heap, if remove a from MH
3. for all other interval, we will merge if overlap. record common free time if no overlap and update a

T(n) = O(nlgn)
