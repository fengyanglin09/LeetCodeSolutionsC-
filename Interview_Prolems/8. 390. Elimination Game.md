## 390. Elimination Game
<pre>
There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. 
Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.

Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.

We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.

Example:

Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

/*

    If we look at the sequence it is always of the form 2^(x) *(1,2,3,4...) where x is from [0,n/2)
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 -> diff=1
      2   4   6   8   10    12 -> 2* (1 2 3 4 5) diff=2
      2       6       10       -> 2* (1 3 5) diff=4
              6                -> Answer
    In order to understand this question, first question yourself does the number of terms
    matter along with the direction in with we are removing the elements. If you think there are
    a total of 4 cases:
    Let n be number of terms in our sequece at any given time, and  direction be either left->right
    or right->left.
    n can odd or even
    cases are:
    n odd direction left->right  [1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,4] FOR ODD DIRECTION DOESN'T MATTER 
    n odd direction right->left  [1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,4] start always increases
    n even direction left->right [1,2,3,4] -> [2,4] start of the sequence was 1 now it is 2
    n even direction right->left [1,2,3,4] -> [1,3] start of the sequence is same as before.
