## 780. Reaching Points

<pre>
A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).

Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty), 
return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.

Examples:
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
Output: True
Explanation:
One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(1, 2) -> (3, 2)
(3, 2) -> (3, 5)

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
Output: False

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
Output: True
</pre>

## Solutions

### Solution3

```c++

/*
Every parent point (x, y) has two children, (x, x+y) and (x+y, y). 
However, every point (x, y) only has one parent candidate (x-y, y) if x >= y, else (x, y-x). 
This is because we never have points with negative coordinates.


Diagram of successive parents of the target point

Looking at previous successive parents of the target point, 
we can find whether the starting point was an ancestor. 
For example, if the target point is (19, 12), 
the successive parents must have been (7, 12), (7, 5), 
and (2, 5); so (2, 5) is a starting point of (19, 12).

Algorithm

Repeatedly subtract the smaller of {tx, ty} from the larger of {tx, ty}. 
The answer is true if and only if we eventually reach sx, sy.


Algorithm

Say tx > ty. We know that the next parent operations will be to subtract ty from tx, 
until such time that tx = tx % ty. When both tx > ty and ty > sy, 
we can perform all these parent operations in one step, replacing while tx > ty: tx -= ty with tx %= ty.

Otherwise, if say tx > ty and ty <= sy, then we know ty will not be changing (it can only decrease). 
Thus, only tx will change, and it can only change by subtracting by ty. 
Hence, (tx - sx) % ty == 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem's answer to be True.

The analysis above was for the case tx > ty, but the case ty > tx is similar. 
When tx == ty, no more moves can be made.


Time Complexity: O(\log(\max{(tx, ty)}))O(log(max(tx,ty))). 
The analysis is similar to the analysis of the Euclidean algorithm
