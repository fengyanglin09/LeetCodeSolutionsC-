## 351. Android Unlock Patterns

Given an Android 3x3 key lock screen and two integers m and n, where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 9, count the total number of unlock patterns of the Android lock screen, which consist of minimum of m keys and maximum n keys.

 

Rules for a valid pattern:

Each pattern must connect at least m keys and at most n keys.
All the keys must be distinct.
If the line connecting two consecutive keys in the pattern passes through any other keys, 
the other keys must have previously selected in the pattern. No jumps through non selected key is allowed.
The order of keys used matters.
 


 
<pre>
Explanation:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 3 - 6
Line 1 - 3 passes through key 2 which had not been selected in the pattern.

Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
Line 1 - 9 passes through key 5 which had not been selected in the pattern.

Valid move: 2 - 4 - 1 - 3 - 6
Line 1 - 3 is valid because it passes through key 2, which had been selected in the pattern

Valid move: 6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
Line 1 - 9 is valid because it passes through key 5, which had been selected in the pattern.


Example:

Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 9

#### Solution
```c++
/*
Analysis
1. we will need to return total # of possible key patterns for different lengths.
   For example, if m = 2, n = 4, then we will need to return sum of # of key patterns of length
   2, 3, 4:
   
   a = Total # of patterns if length is 2
   b = Total # of patterns if length is 3
   c = Total # of patterns if length is 4
    
   return a + b + c
   
2. How to determine if a pattern is valid or not?
   
   The above question can be converted to ask:
   "How to determine if the next digit to include is valid or not?"
   
   i.e., if we are at digit i, and j is one of the options we could go next.
         How could we determine if adding j to the pattern is valid or not?
   
   The next digit j is valid if:
   case1: j is adjcent to i (either from sides or diagonally)
   case2: if i and j are not adjcent, then the node between i and j must have been visited
   
   Note: it is easy to determine for case2 for this problem, because the size of the board is
         only 3 by 3:
   
    1   2   3

    4   5   6
   
    7   8   9
   
   
   How to determine if i and j are adjacent?
   
   since there are only 9 digits, we could use a 10 by 10 array to
   record all the nodes that all not adjacent, the rest must be adjacent.
   
   In addition, each digit can be used only once
