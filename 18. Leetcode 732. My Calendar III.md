## 732. My Calendar III

Implement a MyCalendarThree class to store your events. A new event can always be added.

Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end). 
Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

A K-booking happens when K events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all K events.)

For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return an integer K representing the largest integer such that there exists a K-booking in the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: MyCalendarThree cal = new MyCalendarThree(); MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)

<pre>
Example 1:

MyCalendarThree();
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // returns 2
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // returns 3
Explanation: 
The first two events can be booked and are disjoint, so the maximum K-booking is a 1-booking.
The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum K-booking is a 2-booking.
The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.
Note that the last event locally causes a 2-booking, but the answer is still 3 because
eg. [10, 20), [10, 40), and [5, 15) are still triple booked.
 

Note:

The number of calls to MyCalendarThree.book per test case will be at most 400.
In calls to MyCalendarThree.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].

### Solutions

#### Solution1: Counting

```c++
/*
Method1: counting
the idea is based on the fact that
if two events A and B overlaps, then either A_start < B_end or A_end > B_start:
case1:
          A_start-------------------A_end
B_start-------------B_end

case2:
    A_start----------------------A_end
                 B_start----------------------B_end

if starting points are assigned to 1 and ending points are assinged to -1, and we adding all these #s the sum must be 0. 
If two events overlaps, the sum must be 2 at the highest value and then reduced to 0.
On the other hand, if two events do not overlap, sum will be 1 and then reduced to 0 with -1, then 1, 0 again.

Based on the above observation, we have the algorithm:
1. make sure the intervals are sorted 
2. each interval, we record the start and end points seperately and count them with a corresponding number
3. each start point occurs, its corresponding number will be increased by 1
4. each end point occurs, its corresponding number will be decreased by 1
5. iterate through all the points, and add the corresponding numbers up.
6. The answer will be the highest number we can get from the previous step.

T(n) = O(n^2)
S(n) = O(n)
