## 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), 
where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h.
Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

<pre>
Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
</pre>

### Solutions

#### Method1: Naive Approach
```c++
/*
/*
Method1: Naive Approach + Gready

each person has value and number, where number is # of people in front that are equal or greater in height

step1: sorting people by the # of people in front with heights equal or greater, this is to make sure 
        there are enough people in front when considering individual person.
step2: insert each person p1 to a list:
       1. insert directly if list is empty
       2. insert before a person p2 in list that has equal or greater height compared to p1 and # of people with equal or greater
          height before p2 equals p1.number
       3. insert at last if neither 1 nor 2 is met
       
T(n) = O(nlgn) + O(n^2), where nlgn is for sorting
S(n) = O(n)
